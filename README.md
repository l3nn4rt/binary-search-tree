# Binary Search Tree
Basic implementation of a binary-search tree with animated cli representation.

![alt tag](https://github.com/l3nn4rt/binary-search-tree/raw/master/screenshot.png)

Keys are supposed to be integers, but are stored as strings.
The insertion follows the path established by a numerical order.
Strings that cannot be evaluated as integers will be treated as zeros.

## Build
```
$ make
```

## Usage
```
$ ./AlberoBinario [NODE1 NODE2 ...]
```
The node list is optional: if not specified, a demo tree will be generated.
